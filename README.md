# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes reviews by members of the Amazon Vine program, which is a paid service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products.  The analysis will evaluate bias in Vine Program reviews and inform whether the client should invest in a gift for reviewers.

PySpark was used to perform ETL on available [insert product type here] reviews data in an AWS RDS instance. Once the data was transformed it was loaded into pgAdmin and PySpark is used to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.

## Results
bulleted list that addresses the three questions for unpaid and paid program reviews
